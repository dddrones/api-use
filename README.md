# pokemon, but wrong

In this basic webpage you have a button. If you click on the button, you get a Pokemon, but wrong. All four items on screen are random, changing with every click to give you a whole new Pokemon mash-up, the sprites we all know and love will get new names, random abilities that might not even make sense for them, and a fun little nature to boot. Keep clicking to see all the combinations you can make!
